				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				The Ignite Realtime community is pleased to present "Openfire Meetings", a plugin for Openfire. Openfire Meetings is a complete standalone plugin powered by Jitsi Videobridge, Jitsi Meet, Candy, Fastpath, TogetherJS and other components. It does not depend on any other plugins, although its functionality can be improved when combined with other plugins.

				<h2>Features</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Openfire Meetings provides a web-based real-time communications application that enables the following features:
				<ul>
					<li>Web-based clients based on Jitsi Meet as well as Candy;</li>
					<li>Openfire user authentication directly from web browser;</li>
					<li>Audio and Video conferencing;</li>
					<li>Telephone (SIP) conferencing;</li>
					<li>Online Meeting/Conference hosting and planning;</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				With the optional Openfire Meetings Chrome Extension, these additional features are available:
				<ul>
					<li>Screen sharing;</li>
					<li>Co-browsing;</li>
					<li>Application sharing (PDF presentation, Realtime collaborative scrum board, drawing and text editor)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When a Remote Desktop Control Native Application is combined with the Openfire Meetings Chrome Extension, the following features are enabled:
				<ul>
					<li>Remote desktop control;</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Openfire Fastpath is a solution built on top of Openfire that adds support for managed queued chat requests. Openfire Meetings includes support for Fastpath. This allows all interaction between a website user an agent to occur in Openfire Meetings web clients, which will make available all Openfire Meetings functionality to both parties. Using Openfire Meetings, Fastpath sessions are thus enhanced with audio, video, desktop sharing (
				application and screen), remote control and all other features of Openfire Meetings!

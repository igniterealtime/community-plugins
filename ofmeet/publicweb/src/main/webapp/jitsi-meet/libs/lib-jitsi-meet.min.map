Note though that it was not completely clear from the predating\n * browser-specific implementations what &quot;videoSrc&quot; was because one\n * implementation of {@link RTCUtils#getVideoSrc} would return\n * <tt>MediaStream</tt> (e.g. Firefox), another a <tt>string</tt> representation\n * of the <tt>URL</tt> of the <tt>MediaStream</tt> (e.g. Chrome) and the return\n * value was only used by {@link RTCUIHelper#getVideoId} which itself did not\n * appear to be used anywhere. Generally, the implementation will try to follow\n * the related standards i.e. work with the <tt>srcObject</tt> and <tt>src</tt>\n * properties of the specified <tt>element</tt> taking into account vender\n * prefixes.\n *\n * @param element the element whose video source/src is to be set to the\n * specified <tt>stream</tt>\n * @param {MediaStream} stream the <tt>MediaStream</tt> to set as the video\n * source/src of <tt>element</tt>\n */\nfunction defaultSetVideoSrc(element, stream) {\n    // srcObject\n    let srcObjectPropertyName = 'srcObject';\n\n    if (!(srcObjectPropertyName in element)) {\n        srcObjectPropertyName = 'mozSrcObject';\n        if (!(srcObjectPropertyName in element)) {\n            srcObjectPropertyName = null;\n        }\n    }\n    if (srcObjectPropertyName) {\n        element[srcObjectPropertyName] = stream;\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // src\n    let src;\n\n    if (stream) {\n        src = stream.jitsiObjectURL;\n\n        // Save the created URL for stream so we can reuse it and not keep\n        // creating URLs.\n        if (!src) {\n            stream.jitsiObjectURL\n                = src\n                    = (URL || webkitURL).createObjectURL(stream);\n        }\n    }\n    element.src = src || '';\n}\n\n/**\n *\n */\nclass RTCUtils extends Listenable {\n    /**\n     *\n     */\n    constructor() {\n        super(eventEmitter);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     *\n     * @param options\n     */\n    init(options) {\n        if (typeof options.disableAEC === 'boolean') {\n            disableAEC = options.disableAEC;\n            logger.info(`Disable AEC: ${disableAEC}`);\n        }\n        if (typeof options.disableNS === 'boolean') {\n            disableNS = options.disableNS;\n            logger.info(`Disable NS: ${disableNS}`);\n        }\n\n        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n            if (RTCBrowserType.isFirefox()) {\n                const FFversion = RTCBrowserType.getFirefoxVersion();\n\n                if (FFversion < 40) {\n                    rejectWithWebRTCNotSupported(\n                        `Firefox version too old: ${FFversion}.`\n                            + ' Required >= 40.',\n                        reject);\n\n                    return;\n                }\n                this.RTCPeerConnectionType = mozRTCPeerConnection;\n                this.getUserMedia\n                    = wrapGetUserMedia(\n                        navigator.mozGetUserMedia.bind(navigator));\n                this.enumerateDevices\n                    = wrapEnumerateDevices(\n                        navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices.bind(\n                            navigator.mediaDevices));\n                this.pcConstraints = {};\n                this.attachMediaStream\n                    = wrapAttachMediaStream((element, stream) => {\n                        // srcObject is being standardized and FF will\n                        // eventually support that unprefixed.

There are\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n * stored. Whenever one of these limits is exceeded the <tt>LogCollector</tt>\n * will use the <tt>logStorage</tt> object given as an argument to save\n * the batch log entry.\n *\n * @param {Object} logStorage an object which allows to store the logs collected\n * @param {function(string|object[])} logStorage.storeLogs a method called when\n * this <tt>LogCollector</tt> requests log entry storage. The method's argument\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\n * the following format:\n * {\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\n * }\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\n * the sequence of \"A\". Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>. Otherwise the log entry will be cached until the log\n * storage becomes ready. Note that the \"is ready\" condition is checked every\n * <tt>options.storeInterval</tt> milliseconds.\n * @param {number} options.storeInterval how often the logs should be stored in\n * case <tt>maxEntryLength</tt> was not exceeded.\n * @param {boolean} options.stringifyObjects indicates whether or not object\n * arguments should be \"stringified\" with <tt>JSON.stringify</tt> when a log\n * message is composed.
